81,S006,Savings,Customer,"I'm interested in group savings. Does MTN have any options for my village savings group?"
82,S006,Savings,Bot,"Yes! MTN offers MoKash Group Savings specifically designed for village savings groups like yours. It allows multiple members to contribute to a shared savings goal while maintaining transparency and earning interest. Would you like to know more about how to set up a group savings account?"
83,S006,Savings,Customer,"Yes, our group has 15 members and we meet weekly to contribute. How can we set this up?"
84,S006,Savings,Bot,"Perfect!

Would you like to register your group now?"
85,S006,Savings,Customer,"Yes, I'm the chairperson so I'll be the admin. How much does it cost to register?"
86,S006,Savings,Bot,"There's no registration fee for setting up an MTN Group Savings account. All you need is for each member to have an active MTN Mobile Money account. As the admin, you'll have additional permissions to view all contributions and manage group settings. How much is the typical weekly contribution from each member?"
87,S006,Savings,Customer,"We usually contribute UGX 10,000 per person each week."
88,S006,Savings,Bot,"With 15 members contributing UGX 10,000 weekly, your group will save UGX 150,000 per week or about UGX 600,000 per month. At our 4.5% annual interest rate for group savings, you could earn approximately UGX 27,000 in interest each month. To register, I'll need the group's name and a list of members' MTN numbers. What's your group called?"
89,S006,Savings,Customer,"We're called Bwaise Women's Development Association."
90,S006,Savings,Bot,"Thank you. To register Bwaise Women's Development Association, I'll need the phone numbers of all 15 members. You can either provide them now, or we can start with just a few members and add the rest later through the group management menu. How would you prefer to proceed?"
91,S006,Savings,Customer,"Let's start with 5 main members now and add the rest later. Here are the numbers: 0771234567, 0772345678, 0773456789, 0774567890, and mine which is this number."
92,S006,Savings,Bot,"Thank you. I'll register Bwaise Women's Development Association with the 5 initial members. To complete the setup, please specify: 1) The weekly contribution amount (UGX 10,000 per member) 2) The day of the week for contributions 3) Your savings goal duration (3 months, 6 months, or 12 months) When would you like the weekly contributions to be collected?"
93,S006,Savings,Customer,"We meet every Saturday, so let's set Saturday as our contribution day. And we want to save for 6 months."
94,S006,Savings,Bot,"Great! To summarize: I'm setting up Bwaise Women's Development Association as a Group Savings account with 5 initial members (expandable to 15). Each member will contribute UGX 10,000 every Saturday for a 6-month period. The group will earn 4.5% annual interest. Total expected savings after 6 months: approximately UGX 1,320,000 plus interest. Please enter your PIN to confirm this setup."
95,S006,Savings,Customer,"PIN entered."
96,S006,Savings,Bot,"Thank you! The Bwaise Women's Development Association Group Savings account has been successfully created. As the admin, you'll receive weekly contribution reports and monthly interest updates. All members will be notified about the new group via SMS. The first contribution date is this Saturday, March 15, 2025. Would you like me to explain how to add the remaining 10 members to your group?"
97,S006,Savings,Customer,"Yes, please tell me how to add the other members."
98,S006,Savings,Bot,"To add the remaining members, you have two options: 1) Dial *165*5*8*3# and follow the prompts to add members one by one by entering their MTN numbers 2) Send me the list of numbers, and I can add them for you now Each new member will receive an SMS invitation to join the group, which they must accept. As admin, you can also set contribution reminders and view individual contribution records. Which method would you prefer to use?"
99,S006,Savings,Customer,"I'll collect all the numbers and use the USSD code later this week. Do members have to contribute exactly UGX 10,000 or can they add more sometimes?"
100,S006,Savings,Bot,"Members can contribute more than the minimum UGX 10,000 whenever they wish! While the system will automatically request the minimum amount weekly, any member can make additional contributions by dialing *165*5*8*2# and selecting your group. Extra contributions boost the group's interest earnings. The system will track each member's total contributions separately. Would you like to enable contribution flexibility notifications to remind members of this option?"
101,S006,Savings,Customer,"Yes, that would be helpful for our members."
102,S006,Savings,Bot,"I've enabled contribution flexibility notifications for your group. Members will receive weekly reminders about the minimum UGX 10,000 contribution and the option to contribute more. Based on your group size and savings pattern, you might also be interested in our 'Village Banking' product which includes micro-loans for members. Would you like information about adding lending capabilities to your group?"
103,S006,Savings,Customer,"That sounds interesting. Please tell me more about the Village Banking option."
104,S006,Savings,Bot,"MTN Village Banking extends your group savings with microfinancing capabilities. After 3 months of consistent saving, your group can activate lending functionality where members can borrow up to 3 times their individual contribution total at just 5% interest. Loans are approved by group vote through the mobile platform. Repayments go back into the group fund, increasing everyone's returns. The setup requires additional documentation for security. Would you like to schedule a Village Banking orientation session for your group?"
105,S006,Savings,Customer,"Yes, let's schedule an orientation for next Saturday after our regular meeting, around 3 PM."
106,S006,Savings,Bot,"Perfect! I've scheduled a Village Banking orientation session for Bwaise Women's Development Association on Saturday, March 15, 2025, at 3 PM. An MTN representative will call you to confirm the location details. They'll explain the complete Village Banking features, documentation requirements, and answer any questions your members might have. Is there a specific aspect of Village Banking you're most interested in learning about during the orientation?"
107,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need to pay for some emergency medical expenses. Can I get a quick loan through MTN?"
108,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I'm sorry to hear about the emergency. Yes, MTN MoKash offers quick loans to eligible customers. Based on your Mobile Money transaction history, you may qualify for a loan. Would you like to check your loan eligibility and available amount?"
109,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please check how much I can borrow."
110,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Let me check your eligibility. Based on your Mobile Money history and transaction patterns, you're eligible for a loan of up to UGX 300,000. Loans are repayable within 30 days with a service fee of 9%. For example, if you borrow UGX 100,000, you'll need to repay UGX 109,000 within 30 days. How much would you like to borrow?"
111,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need UGX 200,000 for the medical expenses."
112,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I can process a loan of UGX 200,000 for you. The total amount to repay will be UGX 218,000 within 30 days. The loan will be instantly deposited into your Mobile Money wallet if approved. Would you like to proceed with the loan application?"
113,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please proceed."
114,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"To apply for the UGX 200,000 loan, please confirm by entering your Mobile Money PIN."
115,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered."
116,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. Your loan application is being processed... I'm pleased to inform you that your loan has been approved! UGX 200,000 has been deposited into your Mobile Money wallet. The repayment amount of UGX 218,000 is due by April 8, 2025. You'll receive reminders as the due date approaches. Would you like to set up automatic repayment from your Mobile Money account?"
117,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that would be helpful."
118,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Great! I've set up automatic repayment from your Mobile Money wallet for April 8, 2025. Please ensure you have sufficient funds in your wallet by that date. You can repay earlier at any time by dialing *165# and selecting MoKash > Loans > Repay. Is there anything else you need assistance with regarding your loan?"
119,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"What happens if I can't repay on time?"
120,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"If you're unable to repay by the due date, additional fees may apply and it could affect your eligibility for future loans. The system will attempt to recover the amount from your Mobile Money wallet on the due date. If there are insufficient funds, you'll receive reminders and can make partial payments. If you anticipate difficulty repaying, please contact MTN customer service at 100 to discuss your options. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the repayment process?"
121,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"No, that's all. Thank you."
122,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"You're welcome. I hope the funds help with your medical emergency. Based on your situation, you might want to consider our health insurance options to help cover future medical expenses. Would you like information about MTN's affordable health coverage plans?"
123,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I've heard about MTN MoKash Flex. What is that and how is it different from regular loans?"
124,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"MTN MoKash Flex is our overdraft facility that provides immediate access to funds when your Mobile Money balance is insufficient. Unlike regular MoKash loans, Flex is activated on your account and you only pay for what you use. The service fee is 0.5% per day on the amount used, and you can repay anytime within 30 days. Would you like to check if you're eligible for MoKash Flex?"
125,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, I'd like to know if I'm eligible and what my limit would be."
126,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Let me check your eligibility for MTN MoKash Flex. Based on your Mobile Money transaction history and usage patterns, you qualify for MoKash Flex with a limit of UGX 150,000. This means you can complete transactions even when your wallet balance is insufficient, up to this limit. Would you like me to activate MoKash Flex on your account?"
127,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"How exactly does it work when I make a payment but don't have enough money?"
128,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Great question! Here's how MoKash Flex works: Let's say you need to send UGX 50,000 but only have UGX 20,000 in your wallet. When you initiate the transaction, the system automatically covers the UGX 30,000 shortfall from your Flex limit. Your wallet balance becomes zero, and you'll owe UGX 30,000 plus the daily fee of 0.5% (UGX 150 per day). You can repay anytime within 30 days by simply depositing money into your Mobile Money account. Does that clarify how it works?"
129,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that's clear. And what's the maximum daily fee I could pay?"
130,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"With MoKash Flex, you pay 0.5% per day only on the amount you use. For your limit of UGX 150,000, the maximum daily fee would be UGX 750 if you used the entire limit. However, if you only use, say, UGX 30,000, your daily fee would be just UGX 150. The maximum you would pay over 30 days would be 15% of the amount used. You can minimize costs by repaying quickly. Would you like to activate this service?"
131,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, I'd like to activate it for emergencies."
132,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I'll activate MTN MoKash Flex on your account with a limit of UGX 150,000. This service will allow you to complete transactions even when your wallet balance is insufficient. The daily service fee is 0.5% of the amount used, and you can repay anytime within 30 days. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to confirm activation."
133,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered."
134,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. MTN MoKash Flex has been successfully activated on your account with a limit of UGX 150,000. You can now complete transactions even when your wallet balance is insufficient. You'll receive an SMS notification whenever Flex is used, showing the amount and fees. Would you like me to set up low balance alerts to help you manage your Flex usage?"
135,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that would be helpful. Please set up alerts when my balance goes below UGX 5,000."
136,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I've set up low balance alerts for your Mobile Money account. You'll receive SMS notifications when your balance falls below UGX 5,000. This will help you manage your MoKash Flex usage effectively. Based on your transaction patterns, we recommend depositing at least UGX 20,000 in your wallet every two weeks to minimize Flex usage. Would you like to set up automatic deposits to your Mobile Money account?"
137,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"No automatic deposits for now. If I use Flex, can I repay in installments or must it be all at once?"
138,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"You can repay your MoKash Flex balance in installments! Whenever you deposit money into your Mobile Money wallet, the system automatically allocates a portion to repay your Flex balance. For example, if you deposit UGX 10,000, it might use UGX 5,000 for your Flex repayment and leave UGX 5,000 in your wallet. You can adjust this allocation ratio by dialing *165*5*4*5#. Would you like me to explain more about managing your repayments?"
139,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"No, that's clear enough for now. Thank you for the information."
140,L002,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"You're welcome! Your MTN MoKash Flex is now active and ready to use when needed. Remember, you'll be charged 0.5% per day only on the amount you use, and you can repay anytime within 30 days. Based on your financial activity, you might also be interested in our MoKash Credit Builder program, which helps increase your loan limits over time. Would you like to learn more about improving your credit limit?"
141,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need to borrow money to stock my small shop. What business loan options does MTN have?"
142,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"MTN offers MoKash Business Loans specifically designed for small business owners like you. These loans range from UGX 100,000 to UGX 5,000,000 with repayment periods of 1-3 months. The service fee starts at 8% per month, with lower rates for repeat borrowers. Business loans require at least 6 months of active Mobile Money business transactions. Would you like me to check if you qualify for a business loan?"
143,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes please, check if I qualify. I've been using MTN Mobile Money for my shop transactions for over a year now."
144,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you for that information. Let me check your eligibility... Based on your Mobile Money transaction history, I can see consistent business-related transactions over the past 14 months, which qualifies you for our MoKash Business Loan. You're eligible for a loan of up to UGX 1,500,000 with a service fee of 7.5% per month. How much would you need to stock your shop?"
145,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need about UGX 1,000,000 to buy new inventory. What would be the repayment terms?"
146,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"For a UGX 1,000,000 MoKash Business Loan, you have the following repayment options: 1) 1-month term: Repay UGX 1,075,000 (7.5% fee) 2) 2-month term: Repay UGX 1,150,000 (7.5% monthly fee) 3) 3-month term: Repay UGX 1,225,000 (7.5% monthly fee) You can make equal monthly installments or repay early to save on fees. Which repayment term would work best for your business cash flow?"
147,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"The 3-month option would be best for me. Can I make weekly repayments instead of monthly?"
148,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Yes, you can certainly make weekly repayments! For your UGX 1,000,000 loan with a 3-month term, you would need to repay a total of UGX 1,225,000. If divided into weekly payments, that's approximately UGX 93,500 per week for 13 weeks. Weekly repayments can actually help reduce your overall interest by clearing the principal faster. Would you like me to set up a weekly repayment schedule for you?"
149,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please set up the weekly repayment schedule. Will I get reminders for each payment?"
150,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I'll set up a weekly repayment schedule of UGX 93,500 for your UGX 1,000,000 business loan. You'll receive SMS reminders two days before each payment is due. The system will also attempt to deduct the amount automatically from your Mobile Money wallet every Monday. You can always make additional payments to reduce your principal faster. To proceed with your UGX 1,000,000 loan application, please enter your Mobile Money PIN."
151,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered."
152,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. Your UGX 1,000,000 MoKash Business Loan application is being processed... Congratulations! Your loan has been approved and UGX 1,000,000 has been deposited into your Mobile Money wallet. Your first weekly repayment of UGX 93,500 will be due on Monday, March 17, 2025. Would you like me to help you set up a separate business wallet to manage your loan funds?"
153,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that would be helpful for tracking my business expenses separately."
154,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Great choice! I'll set up an MTN Business Wallet linked to your main account. This will help you track your business expenses separately and simplify your accounting. The Business Wallet has no monthly fees and offers detailed transaction reports for business analytics. Please enter a 4-digit PIN for your new Business Wallet. This can be different from your main Mobile Money PIN for added security."
155,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered for business wallet."
156,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. Your MTN Business Wallet has been created successfully. Would you like to transfer some or all of your UGX 1,000,000 loan to your new Business Wallet now? This will help you keep these funds separate for your shop inventory purchases."
157,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please transfer the entire UGX 1,000,000 to the business wallet."
158,L003,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I've transferred the entire UGX 1,000,000 loan amount to your new Business Wallet.

166,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you for verifying your identity. Here are your current loan details:
Loan Amount: UGX 350,000
Disbursement Date: February 20, 2025
Due Date: March 22, 2025 (11 days from now)
Outstanding Balance: UGX 245,000
Service Fee: UGX 31,500
Total Amount Due: UGX 276,500
Would you like to make a payment towards this loan today?"
167,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, I can pay UGX 100,000 today."
168,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Great! I'll process a payment of UGX 100,000 towards your loan. This will reduce your outstanding balance to UGX 176,500. Please enter your PIN to confirm this payment from your Mobile Money wallet."
169,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered."
170,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. Your payment of UGX 100,000 has been successfully processed. Your updated loan details are:

Due Date: March 22, 2025 (11 days from now)
Would you like to schedule your next payment?"
171,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"When do I pay the service fee? Is it included in my payments or paid separately at the end?"
172,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Good question! The service fee of UGX 31,500 is included in your total repayment amount. Every payment you make is allocated proportionally between the principal and the service fee. For example, from your UGX 100,000 payment today, approximately UGX 87,000 went toward the principal and UGX 13,000 toward the service fee. You don't need to pay the service fee separately - it's all handled automatically in the repayment process. Does that clarify how the fee is handled?"
173,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that's clear. If I want to pay off the entire loan early, will I still pay the full service fee?"
174,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"If you pay off your loan early, you'll still pay the full service fee of UGX 31,500. Unlike traditional interest which accrues over time, our service fee is a flat fee applied when the loan is disbursed. However, paying early has other benefits: 1) It improves your credit score in our system 2) It increases your eligibility for higher loan amounts in the future 3) It frees up your loan facility for new borrowing if needed Would you like to pay off your entire remaining balance of UGX 176,500 today?"
175,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Not today, but I'll plan to pay it off next week. Will I get a reminder before the due date?"
176,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Yes, you'll receive automatic SMS reminders 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before your due date of March 22, 2025. These reminders will include your outstanding balance and payment instructions. I can also set up an additional custom reminder for you for next week when you plan to pay off the loan. Would you like me to set a special reminder for a specific day next week?"
177,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please set a reminder for Wednesday, March 19th."
178,L004,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I've set a special reminder for you on Wednesday, March 19th, to pay your remaining loan balance of UGX 176,500. You'll receive an SMS notification on that day. Based on your consistent loan repayment history, you're eligible for our MoKash Gold status, which offers lower service fees and higher loan limits.

In fact, we encourage early repayment as it improves your credit score and may increase your future loan limits. You'll still pay the full service fee, but repaying early gives you the flexibility to take another loan sooner if needed. Would you like me to check your current loan balance for early repayment?"
183,L005,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please check my current loan balance."
