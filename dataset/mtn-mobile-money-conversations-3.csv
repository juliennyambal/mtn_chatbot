1,S001,Savings,Customer,"Hello, I want to save some money with MTN MoKash. How does it work?"
2,S001,Savings,Bot,"Welcome to MTN MoKash! You can save money and earn interest of up to 5% per year. You can deposit as little as UGX 500, and your savings are secure. Would you like me to help you set up a savings goal or make a deposit?"
3,S001,Savings,Customer,"I'd like to save UGX 100,000 for my daughter's school fees in 3 months. Can I set that as a goal?"
4,S001,Savings,Bot,"Absolutely! I can help you create a school fees savings goal. With a target of UGX 100,000 in 3 months, you would need to save approximately UGX 33,334 per month to reach your goal. Would you like to set up automatic deposits or manual deposits?"
5,S001,Savings,Customer,"I prefer automatic deposits every week from my MTN Mobile Money wallet. Is that possible?"
6,S001,Savings,Bot,"Yes, we can set up automatic weekly deposits of UGX 8,334 from your Mobile Money wallet to your MoKash savings account. This will help you reach your UGX 100,000 goal in 3 months. Should I set this up for you now?"
7,S001,Savings,Customer,"Yes, please go ahead."
8,S001,Savings,Bot,"To confirm, I'll set up automatic weekly deposits of UGX 8,334 from your Mobile Money wallet to your MoKash account for your daughter's school fees goal. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to authorize this setup."
9,S001,Savings,Customer,"I've entered my PIN."
10,S001,Savings,Bot,"Thank you! Your automatic savings plan has been set up successfully. Deposits of UGX 8,334 will be made every Monday starting next week. You'll receive SMS notifications for each transaction. You can check your savings progress anytime by dialing *165# and selecting MoKash. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your savings plan?"
11,S001,Savings,Customer,"What happens if I need to withdraw before the 3 months are up?"
12,S001,Savings,Bot,"You can withdraw from your MoKash savings account at any time by dialing *165# and selecting MoKash > Withdraw. There are no penalties for early withdrawal, but remember that the longer you save, the more interest you earn. Interest is calculated daily and paid monthly. Would you like to know about our higher interest rate options for longer-term savings?"
13,S001,Savings,Customer,"No, that's all I needed for now. Thank you."
14,S001,Savings,Bot,"You're welcome! Your savings journey is now underway. Remember, you can increase your deposit amount anytime to reach your goal faster. Based on your savings goal for school fees, you might also be interested in our education insurance products. Would you like to learn more about protecting your daughter's education?"
15,S001,Savings,Customer,"Not right now, maybe next time."
16,S001,Savings,Bot,"No problem. Thank you for choosing MTN MoKash for your savings needs. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"
17,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need to pay for some emergency medical expenses. Can I get a quick loan through MTN?"
18,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I'm sorry to hear about the emergency. Yes, MTN MoKash offers quick loans to eligible customers. Based on your Mobile Money transaction history, you may qualify for a loan. Would you like to check your loan eligibility and available amount?"
19,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please check how much I can borrow."
20,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Let me check your eligibility. Based on your Mobile Money history and transaction patterns, you're eligible for a loan of up to UGX 300,000. Loans are repayable within 30 days with a service fee of 9%. For example, if you borrow UGX 100,000, you'll need to repay UGX 109,000 within 30 days. How much would you like to borrow?"
21,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"I need UGX 200,000 for the medical expenses."
22,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I can process a loan of UGX 200,000 for you. The total amount to repay will be UGX 218,000 within 30 days. The loan will be instantly deposited into your Mobile Money wallet if approved. Would you like to proceed with the loan application?"
23,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, please proceed."
24,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"To apply for the UGX 200,000 loan, please confirm by entering your Mobile Money PIN."
25,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"PIN entered."
26,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Thank you. Your loan application is being processed... I'm pleased to inform you that your loan has been approved! UGX 200,000 has been deposited into your Mobile Money wallet. The repayment amount of UGX 218,000 is due by April 8, 2025. You'll receive reminders as the due date approaches. Would you like to set up automatic repayment from your Mobile Money account?"
27,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Yes, that would be helpful."
28,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Great! I've set up automatic repayment from your Mobile Money wallet for April 8, 2025. Please ensure you have sufficient funds in your wallet by that date. You can repay earlier at any time by dialing *165# and selecting MoKash > Loans > Repay. Is there anything else you need assistance with regarding your loan?"
29,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"What happens if I can't repay on time?"
30,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"If you're unable to repay by the due date, additional fees may apply and it could affect your eligibility for future loans. The system will attempt to recover the amount from your Mobile Money wallet on the due date. If there are insufficient funds, you'll receive reminders and can make partial payments. If you anticipate difficulty repaying, please contact MTN customer service at 100 to discuss your options. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the repayment process?"
31,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"No, that's all. Thank you."
32,L001,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"You're welcome. I hope the funds help with your medical emergency. Based on your situation, you might want to consider our health insurance options to help cover future medical expenses. Would you like information about MTN's affordable health coverage plans?"
33,R001,Remittance,Customer,"My daughter in London wants to send me money. How can she do that through MTN?"
34,R001,Remittance,Bot,"Your daughter can send you money from London through several international money transfer services that partner with MTN Mobile Money. Our partners include WorldRemit, Western Union, MoneyGram, and Remitly. Once she sends the money, it will be deposited directly into your MTN Mobile Money wallet. Would you like details on a specific service she could use?"
35,R001,Remittance,Customer,"Yes, please tell me about WorldRemit. She mentioned that one."
36,R001,Remittance,Bot,"WorldRemit is an excellent choice for sending money from the UK to Uganda. Here's how it works:
1. Your daughter needs to create an account on WorldRemit's website or mobile app
2. She'll select Uganda as the destination country and MTN Mobile Money as the delivery method
3. She'll enter your MTN number (beginning with 077 or 078)
4. She'll choose the amount to send in GBP (British Pounds)
5. She can pay using her debit card, credit card, or bank transfer
6. Once processed, you'll receive the money directly in your MTN Mobile Money wallet, usually within minutes

Would you like me to send these instructions to your daughter via SMS?"
37,R001,Remittance,Customer,"That would be helpful. Her name is Sarah and her number is +44 7700 900123."
38,R001,Remittance,Bot,"I've sent the WorldRemit instructions to Sarah at +44 7700 900123. She should receive them shortly. When she initiates the transfer, you'll receive an SMS notification. Once the money arrives in your Mobile Money wallet, you can withdraw it at any MTN Mobile Money agent, transfer it to others, pay bills, or keep it in your wallet. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about receiving international transfers?"
39,R001,Remittance,Customer,"How much will she have to pay in fees?"
40,R001,Remittance,Bot,"WorldRemit's fees depend on the amount sent, but typically range from £2.99 to £4.99 for transfers from the UK to Uganda. The exchange rate offered is usually competitive and better than many banks. There are no fees for you to receive the money in Uganda - you'll get the full amount she sends. Would you like me to check the current exchange rate for GBP to UGX?"
41,R001,Remittance,Customer,"Yes, please."
42,R001,Remittance,Bot,"The current exchange rate is approximately 1 GBP = 4,700 UGX. This means if Sarah sends £100, you would receive about UGX 470,000 in your Mobile Money wallet. Please note that exchange rates fluctuate, so the actual rate at the time of transfer may vary slightly. Is there anything else you'd like to know about receiving money from abroad?"
43,R001,Remittance,Customer,"How will I know when the money arrives?"
44,R001,Remittance,Bot,"You'll receive an SMS notification on your MTN number as soon as the money is deposited into your Mobile Money wallet. The message will show the amount received in UGX, the sender's name, and your updated Mobile Money balance. Typically, transfers from WorldRemit arrive within minutes after being sent. Would you like me to set up an additional notification for remittance receipts?"
45,R001,Remittance,Customer,"No, the SMS is enough. Thank you for your help."
46,R001,Remittance,Bot,"You're welcome! Based on your interest in international money transfers, you might benefit from our MTN Homeland service, which offers special rates and benefits for regular remittance receivers. Would you like to learn more about this service?"

47,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"I need to send money to my uncle, but he uses Airtel, not MTN. Is that possible?"
48,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Yes, you can definitely send money to an Airtel user through MTN Mobile Money. This is called an 'off-net' or 'cross-network' transfer. You can send money directly to your uncle's Airtel number, and he'll receive it in his Airtel Money wallet. Would you like me to guide you through the process?"
49,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"Yes, please. I want to send him UGX 50,000."
50,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Here's how to send UGX 50,000 to your uncle's Airtel number:

1. Dial *165# on your phone
2. Select option 1 for 'Send Money'
3. Select option 3 for 'Other Networks'
4. Select 'Airtel' from the list of networks
5. Enter your uncle's Airtel number (starting with 075)
6. Enter the amount: UGX 50,000
7. Enter your reason for sending (optional)
8. Confirm the details
9. Enter your Mobile Money PIN to complete the transaction

The transaction fee for sending UGX 50,000 to Airtel is UGX 1,600. Your uncle will receive the full UGX 50,000. Would you like to proceed with this transfer now?"
51,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"That fee seems high. Is there a cheaper way to send it?"
52,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"I understand your concern about the fee. Here are some alternatives:

1. Mobile Money Promotion: We sometimes run promotions with reduced fees for cross-network transfers. Currently, there's a 25% discount on weekend transfers, which would reduce your fee to UGX 1,200 if you send on Saturday or Sunday.

2. MoMoPay: If your uncle is near a merchant that accepts MoMoPay, you could send money to your uncle for free, and he could use it to pay at that merchant.

3. Group Collections: If you regularly send money to multiple people, including Airtel users, our Group Collections feature might save you on total fees.

Would any of these options work better for you?"
53,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"I'll wait until the weekend to benefit from the discount. Can you remind me about this on Saturday?"
54,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"I've set a reminder for you for this Saturday, March 12th, to send UGX 50,000 to your uncle's Airtel number. You'll receive a notification on Saturday morning. Just to confirm, what is your uncle's Airtel number?"
55,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"It's 0751234567."
56,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Thank you. I've saved the reminder to send UGX 50,000 to Airtel number 0751234567 this Saturday. You'll receive a 25% discount on the transaction fee. Is there anything else you'd like to know about sending money to other networks?"
57,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"Is there a limit to how much I can send to Airtel users?"
58,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Yes, there are daily transaction limits for cross-network transfers:

1. Minimum amount: UGX 500
2. Maximum per transaction: UGX 2,000,000
3. Daily limit: UGX 5,000,000

These limits are set by the Uganda Communications Commission and apply to all mobile money providers. Your personal limit may be lower depending on your Mobile Money tier level. Would you like me to check your current transaction limits?"
59,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"Yes, please check my limits."
60,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Based on your account status, your current daily transaction limits are:

1. Single transaction maximum: UGX 1,000,000
2. Daily transaction total: UGX 3,000,000

You're on our Silver tier. To increase these limits, you can upgrade to Gold tier by visiting any MTN service center with your ID and proof of income or residence. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment to upgrade your tier?"
61,T001,Money Transfers,Customer,"Not right now, thanks. The current limits are fine for me."
62,T001,Money Transfers,Bot,"Understood. Based on your transfer patterns, you might be interested in our Frequent Sender Rewards program, which gives you points for every transfer that can be redeemed for airtime or data. Would you like to enroll in this program?"

63,A001,Account Status,Customer,"I'd like to check my Mobile Money account status and get a statement for the last 3 months."
64,A001,Account Status,Bot,"I'd be happy to help you check your account status and get a statement. First, let me provide you with your current account information:

66,A001,Account Status,Bot,"I can send your 3-month statement by email. Please confirm the email address you'd like me to use."
67,A001,Account Status,Customer,"Please send it to johndoe@gmail.com"
68,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Thank you. To protect your account information, I need to verify your identity before sending the statement. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN."
69,A001,Account Status,Customer,"PIN entered."
70,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Thank you for verifying your identity. I've generated your 3-month statement and sent it to johndoe@gmail.com. You should receive it within the next 10 minutes. The statement includes all transactions from December 8, 2024, to March 8, 2025, including:

- Mobile Money deposits and withdrawals

- Service fees

Is there any specific transaction or category you'd like me to provide more details about?"
71,A001,Account Status,Customer,"I made a payment to Umeme (electricity) last month but I don't remember the amount. Can you tell me what it was?"
72,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Let me check that for you... You made a payment of UGX 87,500 to Umeme on February 15, 2025. The payment reference was UMEME-10253698. The transaction ID was MM765432108. Would you like me to set up automatic bill payments for your Umeme account to help you manage your electricity bills?"
73,A001,Account Status,Customer,"That might be helpful. How does the automatic payment work?"
74,A001,Account Status,Bot,"MTN's automatic bill payment for Umeme works like this:

1. You set a maximum amount that can be automatically paid each month
2. When Umeme issues your bill, MTN will automatically pay it if it's within your set limit
3. You'll receive an SMS notification before and after each payment
4. You can cancel or modify the arrangement at any time
5. There's no additional fee for this service

For example, if you set a limit of UGX 100,000, any Umeme bill under that amount will be paid automatically. If a bill exceeds your limit, you'll receive a notification to approve it manually. Would you like to set up automatic payments for Umeme?"
75,A001,Account Status,Customer,"Yes, let's set it up with a limit of UGX 100,000."
76,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Great! To set up automatic payments for Umeme with a limit of UGX 100,000, I'll need your Umeme customer number. This is usually a 10-digit number that appears on your electricity bill."
77,A001,Account Status,Customer,"My Umeme number is 0123456789."
78,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Thank you. To confirm, I'm setting up automatic payments for Umeme customer number 0123456789 with a monthly limit of UGX 100,000. Payments will be made automatically from your Mobile Money wallet whenever Umeme issues a bill that's within your limit. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to authorize this setup."
79,A001,Account Status,Customer,"PIN entered."
80,A001,Account Status,Bot,"Thank you. Your automatic payment for Umeme has been successfully set up. You will receive an SMS confirmation shortly. Based on your transaction history, I notice you frequently send money to the same 3-5 people. Would you like to create a 'Favorite Recipients' list to make these transfers faster in the future?"
