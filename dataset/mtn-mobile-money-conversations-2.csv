There are no penalties for withdrawals, though frequent withdrawals from fixed-term plans may affect your interest earnings. Would you like to make a withdrawal now?"
69,S107,Savings,Customer,"Not now, but good to know it's that quick. Is there a fee for withdrawals?"
70,S107,Savings,Bot,"There's no fee for transferring funds from your MoKash savings to your main Mobile Money wallet. However, if you then withdraw cash from your Mobile Money wallet at an agent, standard Mobile Money withdrawal fees will apply (ranging from UGX 500 to UGX 7,000 depending on the amount). Many customers avoid these fees by keeping funds digital and making payments directly from Mobile Money. Does that clarify the fee structure?"
71,L107,Loans/Overdraft,Customer,"Can I increase my loan limit? I've been a good customer."
72,L107,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Yes, you can increase your loan limit! Based on your excellent repayment history, you're eligible for our Limit Boost program.

82,L108,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"I understand financial challenges can arise. Yes, MTN MoKash offers a one-time extension of 7 days for loan repayments. This extension comes with a small fee of 2% of your outstanding balance. Alternatively, we can restructure your loan into smaller weekly payments. To proceed with either option, I'll need to understand your situation better. When do you think you'll be able to make the payment?"
83,R108,Remittance,Customer,"How can I track if the money I sent was received?"
84,R108,Remittance,Bot,"You can track your money transfer in several ways: 1) Check your transaction history by dialing *165# and selecting 'My Account' > 'Transactions' 2) Look for 'Completed' status beside your transaction 3) The system sends automatic SMS confirmations when funds are delivered.

112,L111,Loans/Overdraft,Bot,"Yes, you can still qualify for an MTN MoKash loan even if you have outstanding loans with other providers.
