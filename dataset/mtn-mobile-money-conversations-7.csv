1,S001,Savings,Customer,Hello, I want to save some money with MTN MoKash. How does it work?
2,S001,Savings,Bot,Welcome to MTN MoKash! You can save money and earn interest of up to 5% per year. You can deposit as little as GX 500, and your savings are secure. Would you like me to help you set up a savings goal or make a deposit?
3,S001,Savings,Customer,I'd like to save UGX 100,000 for my daughter's school fees in 3 months. Can I set that as a goal?
4,S001,Savings,Bot,Absolutely! I can help you create a school fees savings goal. With a target of UGX 100,000 in 3 months, you would need to save approximately UGX 33,334 per month to reach your goal. Would you like to set up automatic deposits or manual deposits?
5,S001,Savings,Customer,I prefer automatic deposits every week from my MTN Mobile Money wallet. Is that possible?
6,S001,Savings,Bot,Yes, we can set up automatic weekly deposits of UGX 8,334 from your Mobile Money wallet to your MoKash savings account. This will help you reach your UGX 100,000 goal in 3 months. Should I set this up for you now?
7,S001,Savings,Customer,Yes, please go ahead.
8,S001,Savings,Bot,To confirm, I'll set up automatic weekly deposits of UGX 8,334 from your Mobile Money wallet to your MoKash account for your daughter's school fees goal. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to authorize this setup.
9,S001,Savings,Customer,I've entered my PIN.
10,S001,Savings,Bot,Thank you! Your automatic savings plan has been set up successfully. Deposits of UGX 8,334 will be made every Monday starting next week. You'll receive SMS notifications for each transaction. You can check your savings progress anytime by dialing 165# and selecting MoKash. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your savings plan?
11,S001,Savings,Customer,What happens if I need to withdraw before the 3 months are up?
12,S001,Savings,Bot,You can withdraw from your MoKash savings account at any time by dialing *165# and selecting MoKash > Withdraw. There are no penalties for early withdrawal, but remember that the longer you save, the more interest you earn. Interest is calculated daily and paid monthly. Would you like to know about our higher interest rate options for longer-term savings?
13,S001,Savings,Customer,No, that's all I needed for now. Thank you.
14,S001,Savings,Bot,You're welcome! Your savings journey is now underway. Remember, you can increase your deposit amount anytime to reach your goal faster.

15,S001,Savings,Customer,Not right now, maybe next time.
16,S001,Savings,Bot,No problem. Thank you for choosing MTN MoKash for your savings needs. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
17,S002,Savings,Customer,I heard MTN has a new savings product. What's the minimum amount I can save?
18,S002,Savings,Bot,That's right! Our MTN MoKash savings product allows you to save with as little as UGX 500. There's no maximum limit, and you can earn up to 5% interest per year depending on how long you keep your savings. Would you like to learn more about our different savings options?
19,S002,Savings,Customer,Yes, what are the different options available?
20,S002,Savings,Bot,MTN MoKash offers three savings options: 1) Standard Savings with 3% annual interest, accessible anytime. 2) Target Savings with 4% interest for specific goals like education or housing. 3) Fixed Savings with 5% interest where your money is locked for a chosen period (3, 6, or 12 months). Which option interests you most?
21,S002,Savings,Customer,The Fixed Savings sounds good. If I save UGX 200,000 for 6 months, how much interest will I earn?
22,S002,Savings,Bot,With our Fixed Savings at 5% annual interest, if you save UGX 200,000 for 6 months, you would earn approximately UGX 5,000 in interest (minus any applicable taxes). Your total balance after 6 months would be around UGX 205,000. Would you like to open a Fixed Savings account?
23,S002,Savings,Customer,Yes, I'd like to open a 6-month Fixed Savings account.
24,S002,Savings,Bot,Great choice! To open a 6-month Fixed Savings account, you'll need to make an initial deposit. How much would you like to deposit to start your Fixed Savings?
25,S002,Savings,Customer,I'll start with UGX 150,000 for now.
26,S002,Savings,Bot,Excellent! I'll set up a 6-month Fixed Savings account with an initial deposit of UGX 150,000 from your Mobile Money wallet. This will earn 5% annual interest. Your funds will be locked until September 11, 2025. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to proceed with the deposit.
27,S002,Savings,Customer,PIN entered.
28,S002,Savings,Bot,Thank you! Your 6-month Fixed Savings account has been successfully created with an initial deposit of UGX 150,000. Your maturity date is September 11, 2025, when your balance (including interest) will be available for withdrawal. You'll receive monthly updates via SMS. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your new savings account?
29,S002,Savings,Customer,Can I add more money to this Fixed Savings account later?
30,S002,Savings,Bot,Unfortunately, our Fixed Savings accounts don't allow additional deposits after the initial setup. However, you can open multiple Fixed Savings accounts with different amounts and maturity dates. Alternatively, you could open a Standard Savings account alongside your Fixed Savings to make additional deposits anytime. Would you like to set up another savings account?
31,S002,Savings,Customer,Not right now, thank you.
32,S002,Savings,Bot,You're welcome! Your Fixed Savings account is now active and growing. Remember to check your monthly SMS updates to track your interest.

33,S003,Savings,Customer,I want to save for my wedding next year. Can MTN help with that?
34,S003,Savings,Bot,Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! MTN MoKash's Target Savings is perfect for wedding planning. You can set a specific target amount and date, track your progress, and earn 4% annual interest. We can even help you set up a regular savings schedule. When is your wedding planned for?
35,S003,Savings,Customer,The wedding is planned for May 15, 2026, and I need about UGX 3 million.
36,S003,Savings,Bot,Thank you for sharing your wedding details. To save UGX 3 million by May 15, 2026 (about 14 months from now), you would need to save approximately UGX 214,286 per month. With our Target Savings at 4% interest, you'll also earn about UGX 87,500 in interest over this period. Would you like to set up this wedding savings goal?
37,S003,Savings,Customer,That monthly amount is a bit high. Can I save UGX 150,000 per month instead?
38,S003,Savings,Bot,Absolutely, you can save UGX 150,000 per month. With this amount, you'll save approximately UGX 2.1 million over 14 months, plus around UGX 61,250 in interest, totaling about UGX 2,161,250. This would bring you to about 72% of your UGX 3 million goal. Would you like to extend your timeline or adjust your target amount?
39,S003,Savings,Customer,Let's adjust the target to UGX 2.2 million then.
40,S003,Savings,Bot,Perfect! I'll set up a Target Savings goal of UGX 2.2 million for your wedding by May 15, 2026, with monthly deposits of UGX 150,000. With the 4% interest, you should actually slightly exceed your target. Would you prefer these deposits to be automatic or manual?
41,S003,Savings,Customer,Automatic please, on the 15th of each month.
42,S003,Savings,Bot,I'll set up automatic deposits of UGX 150,000 from your Mobile Money wallet to your MoKash Wedding Target Savings account on the 15th of each month, starting March 15, 2025. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to authorize this setup.

60,S004,Savings,Bot,I'll update your automatic savings schedule to deposit UGX 75,000 on the 15th of each month, starting from March 15, 2025. This will help you reach your 'Home Renovation' goal faster. Please enter your PIN to confirm this change.

62,S004,Savings,Bot,Thank you for confirming. Your automatic savings deposit has been successfully updated to UGX 75,000 per month.

Projected balance by December 2025: UGX 1,530,000

You're on track to exceed your goal of UGX 1,500,000! Is there anything else you'd like to know about your savings plan?"
65,S005,Savings,Customer,I need to withdraw from my MoKash savings for an emergency.
66,S005,Savings,Bot,I'm sorry to hear about your emergency. You can withdraw from your MoKash savings account at any time. Your current total savings balance is UGX 526,400. How much would you like to withdraw?
67,S005,Savings,Customer,I need UGX 300,000 for medical bills.
68,S005,Savings,Bot,I can process a withdrawal of UGX 300,000 from your MoKash savings account to your Mobile Money wallet. This will leave UGX 226,400 in your savings. Please note that early withdrawals from Fixed Savings accounts may incur a fee, but Standard and Target Savings can be withdrawn without penalties. Please enter your Mobile Money PIN to authorize this withdrawal.
69,S005,Savings,Customer,PIN entered.
70,S005,Savings,Bot,Thank you. Your withdrawal of UGX 300,000 has been processed successfully. The money has been transferred to your Mobile Money wallet and is available immediately. Your remaining MoKash savings balance is UGX 226,400. Given your emergency medical expense, would you like information about MTN's health insurance options to help cover future medical costs?
71,S005,Savings,Customer,Not right now. Will this withdrawal affect my interest earnings?
72,S005,Savings,Bot,Yes, your interest earnings will be affected since they're calculated based on your daily balance. With your new balance of UGX 226,400, you'll earn approximately UGX 754 per month in interest (at 4% annual rate) instead of the previous UGX 1,755 per month. Would you like to set up a savings recovery plan to rebuild your savings after this emergency?
73,S005,Savings,Customer,That's a good idea. What would you suggest?
74,S005,Savings,Bot,I recommend our 'Bounce Back' savings plan, which temporarily increases your regular deposits to help recover from withdrawals. Based on your current pattern of UGX 50,000 monthly deposits, I suggest increasing to UGX 75,000 for the next 4 months. This would help you recover the UGX 300,000 withdrawal while minimizing the impact on your long-term savings goal. Would you like to activate this plan?
75,S005,Savings,Customer,Yes, let's do that.
76,S005,Savings,Bot,Great! I'll set up your 'Bounce Back' plan with increased deposits of UGX 75,000 per month for the next 4 months (March through June 2025), after which it will return to your regular UGX 50,000 monthly deposit. Please enter your PIN to confirm this arrangement.
77,S005,Savings,Customer,PIN entered.
78,S005,Savings,Bot,Thank you for confirming. Your 'Bounce Back' savings plan has been activated. Your next deposit of UGX 75,000 will be processed on March 15, 2025. You'll receive notifications before each increased deposit. With this plan, you should recover your withdrawal by July 2025. I've also made a note about this emergency withdrawal being for medical reasons. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
79,S005,Savings,Customer,No, that's all. Thank you for your help.
80,S005,Savings,Bot,You're welcome. I hope everything goes well with your medical situation. Remember, you can always adjust your savings plan as needed. For future planning, you might want to consider setting up a separate emergency fund that you can access without disrupting your main savings goals. Would you like information about setting up an emergency savings account?
